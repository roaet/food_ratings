# Keto Chow - Meal Replacement Shake Mix

A variety pack is available on amazon. I highly doubt we will ever want to use Avocado Oil (AO) as we tend to enjoy heavy whipping cream (HWC).

## Flavor Ratings (Summary)

- Snickerdoodle (HWC): 6/10
- Strawberry (HWC): 8.5/10

## Flavor Commentary

### Snickerdoodle (Heavy Whipping Cream)

```
roaet: 6/10
suki: 6/10
```

> I am very aware this is a protein shake of some sort; not even surprised, maybe disappointed - roaet

### Strawberry (Heavy Whipping Cream)

```
roaet: 9/10
suki: 8/10
```

> I wish it was colder so I could be 100% confused that it isn't melted strawberry icecream - roaet
